# Pollard's Kangaroo Algorithm
The code implements the Pollard's Kangaroo algorithm to search for a private key that corresponds to a specific target Bitcoin address. The goal is to find a private key that produces a compressed public key matching the target Bitcoin address.

# Dependencies
The code makes use of the following third-party Python libraries:

- ecdsa: A library for key manipulation and elliptic curve digital signature algorithm.
- hashlib: A library for hash cryptography, used to calculate SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hashes.
- random: A library for generating random numbers.
- base58: A library for base58 encoding and decoding.

Make sure to install these libraries before running the code.

# Global Variables
- START_KEY: Hexadecimal value of the start of the search interval for the private key.
- END_KEY: Hexadecimal value of the end of the search interval for the private key.
- TARGET_ADDRESS: The target Bitcoin address in compressed base58 format.
- MAX_CORES: The maximum number of cores available in the system.

Note: The code is designed to perform a parallel search using multiple "kangaroos" (i.e., extra kangaroo pairs) to speed up the search process. The algorithm uses a combination of normal kangaroos and extra kangaroos to jump through the search space. The distances covered by each kangaroo are recorded as "steps." However, in the debug output provided, the "steps" value doesn't seem to be accurate. The debug output shows the positions and steps of Kangaroo A and B, as well as the positions and steps of each extra kangaroo.

# Run Examples on 66 Puzzle
The code provides debug outputs for two test runs on a specific puzzle (66 Puzzle). The puzzle involves running Kangaroo A from the start range towards Kangaroo B, while also using 4096 extra kangaroos. The HEX DISTANCES between certain extra kangaroos are also calculated, and the number of keys checked by each kangaroo every 2 minutes is recorded.

Note: The calculated value for the number of keys checked by each kangaroo every 2 minutes (71,000,064 keys) might not be correct, as indicated in the comment.

The code seems to be a work in progress, and there are some concerns about the accuracy of the "steps" value and the overall efficiency of the algorithm. Further testing and optimization might be required to improve the results.

# Hashpower-based Alternative


# Code Functions Explanation

    address_to_binary(address):
        Description: This function takes a Bitcoin address in compressed base58 format as input and converts it into binary format. It is used to convert the target Bitcoin address (TARGET_ADDRESS) into binary form, which is required for comparison during the search process.

    check_hit(private_key_value, public_key_compressed, target_address_binary, hit_results, extra_kangaroo_index=None):
        Description: This function checks if a given private key corresponds to the target Bitcoin address. It takes the private_key_value (integer), public_key_compressed (bytes), target_address_binary (bytes), hit_results (list), and optional extra_kangaroo_index (integer) as input parameters. The function calculates the hash of the compressed public key and compares it with the target_address_binary. If there is a match, it adds the private key and related information to the hit_results list, indicating a successful hit.

    pollards_kangaroo(start, end, target_address_binary, num_extra_kangaroo_pairs=None):

        Description: This is the main function that implements the Pollard's Kangaroo algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem. It aims to find a private key corresponding to the target Bitcoin address within a given range defined by the start and end values. The function utilizes multiple kangaroos (A and B) that hop randomly within the range, trying to find the private key through a collision search with the target address.

        Input Parameters:
            start (integer): The start value of the search range (private key value of Kangaroo A).
            end (integer): The end value of the search range (private key value of Kangaroo B).
            target_address_binary (bytes): The binary representation of the target Bitcoin address.
            num_extra_kangaroo_pairs (integer, optional): The number of additional kangaroo pairs (extra_kangaroos) to use in the search. The default value is set based on the total_extra_kangaroo_pairs variable.

        Algorithm Flow:
            Initialize kangaroo positions and steps for Kangaroo A and B.
            Generate positions for extra_kangaroos with random starting points within the range.
            Perform a collision search:
                Kangaroo A and B randomly hop within the range, calculating public keys and checking for a hit (matching Bitcoin address).
                Extra_kangaroos also hop within the range and perform hit checks concurrently.
            Once a hit is found, the corresponding private key, compressed public key, and any related extra_kangaroo_index are added to the hit_results list.
            The search continues until a hit is found or all kangaroos complete N (2^15) steps without a hit.
            The function outputs the hit_results list containing any successful matches found during the search.

        Note: The function includes debug output for the positions and steps of Kangaroo A and B, as well as the positions and steps of extra_kangaroos at specific intervals (interval value). This is useful for tracking the progress of the search during execution.

# Porting the Project to PyTorch for GPU Parallelization

To leverage the power of GPU parallelization and accelerate the Pollard's Kangaroo algorithm, we will port the existing code to PyTorch. PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework that supports GPU computation, making it ideal for parallelizing compute-intensive tasks like the Pollard's Kangaroo algorithm. Here are the steps we will take to achieve this:

1. **Convert Data to PyTorch Tensors:**
   First, we will convert the critical data, such as the search range (start and end), target address binary, and the positions and steps of kangaroos (A, B, and extra kangaroos), into PyTorch tensors. This conversion will enable us to perform computations on the GPU.

2. **Define Parallel Kangaroo Hopping Function:**
   We will implement a PyTorch function to represent the kangaroo hopping process. This function will handle multiple kangaroo pairs simultaneously, exploiting PyTorch's parallel computation capabilities. Each kangaroo pair will hop randomly within the range and perform the hit checks concurrently.

3. **Implement GPU Parallelization:**
   By specifying the proper device (GPU) during tensor initialization and computations, PyTorch will automatically perform operations on the GPU, leading to significant speedups compared to CPU-based execution. We will utilize multiple GPU cores (if available) to further parallelize the computation.

4. **Optimize and Tune Parameters:**
   To achieve optimal performance, we will fine-tune various parameters, such as the number of extra kangaroo pairs, hopping interval, and hash power used. These optimizations will help balance the workload among the kangaroos and maximize the utilization of GPU resources.

5. **Monitoring and Debugging:**
   During the porting process, we will carefully monitor the execution and performance of the PyTorch-based implementation. Debugging tools and techniques will be employed to ensure correctness and identify any issues that may arise.

6. **Comparison and Verification:**
   We will compare the results obtained from the PyTorch implementation with the original CPU-based implementation to validate the correctness of the GPU-parallelized code. This step is crucial to ensure that the ported version produces identical results.

7. **Benchmarking and Profiling:**
   After successful implementation and verification, we will benchmark the performance of the GPU-parallelized Pollard's Kangaroo algorithm. We will measure the execution time for various problem sizes and compare it to the CPU-based version. Profiling tools will be used to identify potential bottlenecks and further optimize the code.

By following these steps, we will be able to harness the power of GPU parallelization using PyTorch to significantly accelerate the Pollard's Kangaroo algorithm's execution. This acceleration will allow us to search for private keys that correspond to the target Bitcoin address more efficiently and effectively.

## Optimizing Range Subdivision for Kangaroo Algorithm in 66-Bit Puzzle

To achieve the perfect optimization of the Pollard's Kangaroo algorithm for the 66-bit puzzle, we need to carefully choose the range subdivision strategy. The goal is to distribute the work among the kangaroos in a way that maximizes the search efficiency and minimizes the execution time. Here's how we can improve the range subdivision for the 66-bit puzzle:

1. **Understanding the Range Size:**
   The 66-bit puzzle has a total search space of 2^66 possible private keys. To optimize the algorithm, we need to understand the total range size and how it relates to the available computing resources.

2. **Balancing the Workload:**
   For perfect optimization, the workload should be evenly distributed among all the kangaroos. We can achieve this by dividing the total range size (2^66) by the number of kangaroos (both normal and extra) participating in the search. Each kangaroo will be responsible for searching within its assigned subrange.

3. **Number of Extra Kangaroos:**
   In Pollard's Kangaroo algorithm, extra kangaroos provide an opportunity to increase the search speed. We need to determine the ideal number of extra kangaroo pairs to use based on the available computing resources and the desired search time.

4. **Utilizing GPU Parallelization:**
   Since we are working with PyTorch and GPU parallelization, the number of extra kangaroos should be chosen based on the number of available GPU cores. Each extra kangaroo pair will be assigned to a separate GPU core, enabling parallel computation and maximizing the overall search speed.

5. **Hopping Interval and Hash Power:**
   The hopping interval is a critical parameter that determines how far each kangaroo jumps during the search. A smaller hopping interval allows for finer-grained search but may result in more computational steps. We need to find the optimal hopping interval that balances search granularity and computational efficiency.

6. **Hash Power Adjustment:**
   To achieve the perfect optimization, we may need to adjust the hash power used by the kangaroos. Hash power determines the number of keys each kangaroo checks per second. We can fine-tune this parameter to ensure all kangaroos are working at an optimal pace without overwhelming the computing resources.

7. **Monitoring and Dynamic Adjustments:**
   During the search process, we should continuously monitor the performance and efficiency of the kangaroos. If any kangaroo finishes its assigned subrange earlier than others, we can dynamically adjust its hopping interval or hash power to help balance the workload further.

8. **Verification and Benchmarking:**
   Once the optimization is implemented, we need to verify that the algorithm still produces accurate results. Extensive benchmarking should be performed to measure the execution time for different configurations and verify that the search speed is significantly improved compared to non-optimized approaches.

By carefully considering these factors and optimizing the range subdivision, we can achieve the perfect optimization for the 66-bit puzzle using the Pollard's Kangaroo algorithm. This optimization will enable us to efficiently search for private keys corresponding to the target Bitcoin address and significantly reduce the time required to solve the puzzle.
